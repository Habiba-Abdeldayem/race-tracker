Race tracker app
=================================

The Race tracker app simulates the progress of two players in a race. The idea is to demonstrate 
basic concepts of Kotlin coroutines. A user can start, pause, or reset the race with buttons in the 
UI.

## Features

- **Real-Time Race Tracking**: Visualizes the progress of two participants as they "race" against each other.
- **Start/Pause Functionality**: Users can start or pause the race at any time.
- **Reset Option**: Resets the progress of both participants to allow for a new race.
- **Customizable Participants**: Each participant has configurable progress increments and maximum progress.
- **User Interface**: Built using Jetpack Compose for a modern and responsive UI.
